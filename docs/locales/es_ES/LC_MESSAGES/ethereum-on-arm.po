"Like any peer to peer system, Ethereum network health and proper "
"functioning relies on the total number of nodes (which are currently "
"about 10-15K nodes). The majority of these nodes are x86 based servers or"
" desktops, and an important number of them depend on cloud computing "
"services. This may represent a centralization issue as a significant part"
" of the infrastructure depends on a centralized service. As stated on "
"“Mastering Ethereum” by Andreas Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood:"

"**“The health, resilience, and censorship resistance of blockchains "
"depend on having many independently operated and geographically dispersed"
" full nodes. Each full node can help other new nodes obtain the block "
"data to bootstrap their operation, as well as offer the operator an "
"authoritative and independent verification of all transactions and "
"contracts”.**"
